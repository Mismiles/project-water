# Project Water

Water is the most abundant resource on planet earth. Despite this, how often do we stop and ask ourselves; "what is it?", "how is it used?", "what's its current state in planet earth" or "what's so special about it?".

This project aims to answer some of these questions, but also open the audiences eyes to appreciate issues with water today. It ends with portraying some solutions that organisations in the world today are working on. So please, click and welcome yourself through the journey.


## UX
 
This website is for those looking to find out more general information about water. The site does this by allowing the user to go through a journey. 

As a water enthusiast, I want to know more about water, so that I can appreciate the liquid a  bit more.

As someone who is worried about climate change, I want to understand the challenges we face as a result of water polution so that I can find out what I can do about it.

As someone who cares about water poverty, I want to know what the issues we face in the world are, so that I look for solutions to these problems.

As a student wanting to research about water, I want to learn about the substance, its properties, the problems that water encounters everyday and how we are trying to solve these issues. I want to do this to improve my knowledge on water and appreciate what organisations are doing to improve the earth.


The mockup for the project was designed on paper. Please access the url to view: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UntFSllJfbt40sUt2_rEOD2N_3rkxcBZ 

## Features
The beginning of the project shows a navbar with a "drop" as the logo. This "drop" links to the top of the page.

The sections have scroll-spy links on them for quick naivagation.

As you scroll down, you encounter three positive images. The first is a child drinking water, which everyone has experienced. The second is two children playing at the edge of a beach, jumping on the sea. The third is a group of school children experiencing joy at a water pump.

The next section is a few facts about water in text form.

These facts are highlighted deeper in the vieo below.

The next section is about the chemical properties of water and examples of how these present themselves in nature.

The "challenges" section identifies issues with water in the world today.

Naturally, the next section presents solutions to some of these problems using a navbar. Each section shows a different company or project.

Finally comes the "contact us" section, whereby users can fill out a form to get in touch.

The siter closes with a copywrite bar to ensure symmetry from top to bottom. 

 
### Existing Features
- The video feature allowws users to appreciate water facts in an entertaing way. It uses visuals and sound to portray the message.
- The text summary, image and table allows the user to appreciate the chemical properties of water in a summaried text form.
- The solutions feature presents the user with concise information about water projects across the globe. It was made in sections so that the information was not a burden to read.
- The "contact us" section allows for the user to ask for feedback, request more information or even contact the makers to help contribute to the website.


In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea could be a "live news feed" of water news around the world. This could provide the user with "live" snippets of water news.
- Also, a "world water status" map could be used as an interactive tool. This could be designed as an interactive map that the user explores to find out information on the status of water poverty in countries across the world.

## Technologies Used

-[Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
    -This project uses **Bootstrap** to simplify styling
    -CSS was also used to go beyond boostrap's limits.
    
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
